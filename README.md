# liste_fun_with_python
this is my code for project 2 in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LamjAFnybo0
This my code for the python project about list.
I use a fonction but it wasn't see before in the course in ordrer to print what action we want to execute.
I also use match, it seem it doesn't work before python3.10 (actually my python release).
